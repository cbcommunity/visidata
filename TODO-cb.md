# TODO list for Carbon Black Hackathon

1. Separate command line entry points `cbr`, `cbd` for Cb Response and Defense, respectively
2. Better query command line parameters - for example, `-p` for process search, `-b` for binary search, etc. in the Cb Response command line entry point
3. Add secondary screen for events in Cb Response - so "ENTER" will drill down into the process events for a process search entry
4. Add async action commands - isolate, kill process, download file (Live Response), download binary
5. Add secondary screen for async action command status
6. Record cool demo
